    <span class="font-semibold">ClutterChat</span> is a messaging app built with a focus on simplicity and privacy. It was created as a personal project to explore real-time communication and chat application architecture. The goal was to design an easy-to-use chat platform with a clean UI and efficient backend performance.
  
    The app allows users to create and join chat rooms, send messages in real-time, and manage their profiles. It also implements basic user authentication and message persistence, making it a fully functional minimal chat platform.

    Although **ClutterChat** is no longer actively developed, it served as a valuable learning experience in **web application architecture**, **real-time communication**, and **backend integration**. It’s a personal project that helped me experiment with **Node.js**, **WebSockets**, and **database management**. If you’re looking to build a simple chat app, you can take a look at the repository for inspiration or use it as a starting point.
