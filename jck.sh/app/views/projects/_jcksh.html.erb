  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-clifford mb-4">Rails jck.sh Personal Site</h3>
  
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Welcome to <span class="font-semibold">jck.sh</span>, my personal space on the web where I showcase the various experiments, side projects, and random coding challenges I’ve worked on (and continue to explore). This site is built using <span class="font-semibold">Ruby on Rails</span>, which I use to power both the backend and serve as a playground for trying out new technologies and patterns I come across. 

    The main goal of this site? Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. It’s part <span class="font-semibold">portfolio</span>, part <span class="font-semibold">sandbox</span>, and part <span class="font-semibold">collection of nerdy experiments</span>. From game mods to automation tools, everything I build here is an attempt to explore new ideas and keep growing as a developer. It’s all about learning, improving, and, of course, sharing with the world.
  
    It’s fully functional but very much a <span class="font-semibold">work in progress</span>, meaning the content and features evolve as I get bored and decide to try something new. Whether I’m refining the design, testing out a new framework, or experimenting with APIs, you’ll find me continuously tinkering with something on this site. It’s a living, breathing reflection of my journey in <span class="font-semibold">web development</span> and <span class="font-semibold">backend programming</span>, and I love having the freedom to try things out on my own terms.
